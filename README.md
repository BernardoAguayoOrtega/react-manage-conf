# react-manage-conf

create a platform to keep track of attendees at the Conf, making it possible for each registered user to enter their personal information. Each of them will have a different role and this will be reflected in their insignia. Finally, you will create a page that will be able to list all the participants and filter them by type of role, or search by name.
